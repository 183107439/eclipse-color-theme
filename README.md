Eclipse Color Theme
===================

Color themes for Eclipse.

[![Flattr this](http://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png "Flattr this")](http://flattr.com/thing/111560/Eclipse-Color-Theme)

Although it is possible to manually change all editor colors in
Eclipse, there is no support for managing multiple color themes. It is
in fact possible by importing/exporting preferences files, but this is
inconvenient and likely to mess up your preferences.

Eclipse 4 will probably solve the issue once and for all by making it
possible to change the user interface via CSS, but I'm not sure when
it will arrive, and neither when I will be able to upgrade.

This plugin will make it possible to import, export and switch color
themes conveniently without affecting other preferences. It is still
work in progress, contributions are welcome.

You can install it from the [update site](http://fhd.github.com/eclipse-color-theme).

Currently supported editors:

* Text
* Java
* Java properties
* XML
* HTML

Available themes:

* [Inkpot](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1143)
* [Zenburn](http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/)

Both converted from the Eclipse preferences files in [this blog entry](http://srand2.blogspot.com/2009/08/eclipse-color-themes.html).
