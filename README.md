Eclipse Color Theme
===================

Color themes for Eclipse.

While Eclipse makes it possible to change the syntax coloring in great
detail, there is no support for managing multiple color themes. It is
possible to achieve that by importing and exporting preferences files,
but this is inconvenient and likely to mess up your preferences.

Eclipse 4 will probably solve the issue once and for all by making it
possible to change the user interface via CSS, but I'm not sure when
it will arrive, and neither when I will be able to upgrade.

Eclipse Color Theme makes it possible to switch color themes
conveniently and without side effects. Support for importing and
exporting of themes is planned.

This is still work in progress, contributions are welcome.

You can install the plugin from the [update site](http://fhd.github.com/eclipse-color-theme).

Currently supported editors:

* Text
* Java
* Java properties
* XML
* HTML

Available themes:

* [Inkpot](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1143)
* [Zenburn](http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/)

Both converted from the Eclipse preferences files in [this blog entry](http://srand2.blogspot.com/2009/08/eclipse-color-themes.html).
